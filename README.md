## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"[Field Name] cannot be empty"*
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Looks like this is not an email"*

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Vanilla JS


### What I learned

I learnt how to use the HTML DOM, manipulating elements using javascript and adding interactivity elements. Not forgetting using functional programming elements provided out of the box by JS

### Continued development

I would like to continue honing my web development skills, priotizing mostly on full stack development.
